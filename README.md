## Deep Learning From Scratch
This project includes implementation of a simple neural network for classification tasks and backpropagation mechanism.<br />
The main building blocks are the following modules:<br />
• Tests folder - includes gradient based tests for backpropagation mechanism<br />
• Neural Network.py - standard neural network.<br />
• function.py - includes all activation functions and its gradients.<br />
• loss function.py - objective loss function "soft-max" and its gradient.<br />
• optimizer.py - implementation of stochastic gradient decent optimizer.<br />
• train.py - implementation of training functions.<br />
• Utils.py - util functions.<br />
• main.py - full network experiments implementation.<br />
